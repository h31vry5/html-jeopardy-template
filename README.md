# html-jeopardy-template
This project contains a single HTML file that is a functional Jeopardy template. Features include ability to handle multiple teams and score tracking. This is a modified version of a template originally developed by jeopardylabs.com.

Template was developed for Science Masters, a science outreach program at the University of Utah School of Medicine geared towards junior high school students.

THis updated version cleans out single files into a folder structure and adds the ability to quickly create your own Jeopardy by reading from a text file.
